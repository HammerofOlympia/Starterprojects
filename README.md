# Starterprojects
The goal is to try to implement a workout log project using vanilla JS,CSS and HTML which has been on the docket since before i knew how to code (some may argue i still don't)
will it be ugly? probably, will it be stuck together with the most hacky, jerry rigged code you've ever seen? almost definitely but it's my first independant project and hopefully will learn alot from it.
